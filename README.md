## Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone this repository
- Navigate to the directory with the cloned code
- Install Hardhat with `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
- Install all required dependencies with `npm install`
- Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project with the same contents as `.env.example`
- Place your secret API keys, private keys, etc. to the `.env` file

  :warning:**DO NOT SHARE YOUR .env FILE IN ANY WAY OR YOU RISK TO LOSE ALL YOUR FUNDS**:warning:

## Build

```
npx hardhat compile
```

<a name="tests"/>

## Test

```
npx hardhat test --network hardhat
```

<a name="run"/>

## Run Scripts

```
npx hardhat run <script file name here> --network <network name here>
```

<a name="deploy"/>

## Deploy

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network name here>
```

Deployment script takes about 5 minutes to complete. Please, be patient!  
After the contracts get deployed you can find their _addresses_ and code verification _URLs_ in the `scripts/deployOutput.json` file (see [Structure of Deploy Output File](#output)).  
Note that this file only refreshes the addresses of contracts that have been successfully deployed (or redeployed). If you deploy only a single contract then its address would get updated and all other addresses would remain untouched and would link to _old_ contracts.  
Please, **do not** write anything to `deployOutput.json` file yourself! It is a read-only file.  
All deployed contracts _are verified_ on Etherscan.

<a name="networks"/>

## Networks

а) **Test** network  
Make sure you have _enough test tokens_ for testnet.

```
npx hardhat run <script name here> --network ethereum_testnet
```

b) **Main** network  
Make sure you have _enough real tokens_ in your wallet. Deployment to the mainnet costs money!

```
npx hardhat run <script name here> --network ethereum_mainnet
```

c) **Local** network

- Run Hardhat node locally:

```
npx hardhat node
```

- Run sripts on the node

```
npx hardhat run <script name here> --network localhost
```

<a name="wallets"/>

## Wallets

For deployment you will need to use either _your existing wallet_ or _a generated one_.

### Using an Existing Wallet

If you choose to use your existing wallet, then you will need to be able to export (copy/paste) its private key. For example, you can export private key from your MetaMask wallet.  
Wallet's address and private key should be pasted into the `.env` file (see [Prerequisites](#preqs)).

### Creating a New Wallet

If you choose to create a fresh wallet for this project, you should use `createWallet` script from `scripts/` directory.

```
node scripts/createWallet.js
```

This will generate a single new wallet and show its address and private key. **Save** them somewhere else!
A new wallet _does not_ hold any tokens. You have to provide it with tokens of your choice.  
Wallet's address and private key should be pasted into the `.env` file (see [Prerequisites](#preqs)).

## Structure of Deploy Output File

This file contains the result of contracts deployment.

It is separated in 2 parts. Each of them represents deployment to testnet or mainnet.  
Each part contains information about all deployed contracts:

- The address of the contract (`address`)
- The URL for Etherscan page with verified code of the contract (`verification`)
